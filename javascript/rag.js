// Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), end to end.

// Five steps: chunk your documents (skipped here, our five docs are
// already short enough to index whole), embed each one, store the
// embeddings in Chroma, retrieve the closest matches at query time, and
// generate an answer grounded in those matches, with citations.
//
// A note on embeddings: the official Chroma client computes embeddings
// locally, in this process, using a small bundled model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
// The first time you run this, Chroma downloads that model, a few tens
// of megabytes, so the very first call is slower and needs internet
// access. After that it's cached and runs offline.
